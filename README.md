### Problem Statement:
We have made a conversational AI chatbot using Google-assisted NLP engine named Dialogflow to process natural language queries pertaining to different types of diamonds and thereby generating filtering parameters to segregate different diamond properties.

### What is Dialogflow?
Dialogflow is a Google assisted NLP engine that essentially works like a chatbot by processing user queries and generating necessary outputs. This processing of user queries is done with the help of Intents and Entities.
#### What is an Intent?
An intent specifies all sort of variations in which a user might enter a query. Besides this specification, there are methods that run in the backend that map each characteristic variable to a particular identifier known as an Entity.
#### What is an Entity?
An entity can be regarded analogous to a python dictionary. A dictionary has a key and an associated value with it. Likewise, an entity has a reference variable and all possible synonyms that associate with that particular reference variable. So, whenever a user enters a query, the query has distinct characteristic values that essentially map to these entities and extract out the reference variable that they indicate.
